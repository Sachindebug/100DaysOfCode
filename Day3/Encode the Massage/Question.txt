You have been given a text message. You have to return the Run-length Encoding of the given message.
Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as the character and a single count. For example, the string "aaaabbbccdaa" would be encoded as "a4b3c2d1a2".
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow:

The first and only line of each test case will contain a string denoting the message.
Note:
It's guaranteed that the message string will have no digits and consists solely of lowercase alphabetic characters.
Output Format:
For each test case, print a single line containing the encoded message string. 

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100000

Where 'N' is the length of the message string.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
3
aabbc
abcd
abbdcaas
Sample Output 1 :
a2b2c1
a1b1c1d1
a1b2d1c1a2s1
